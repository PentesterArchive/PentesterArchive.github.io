## What is the Path.
In Linux, when we run a command, we usually use its relative path. For instance, instead of typing the full path `/usr/bin/whoami`, we simply type `whoami` to execute the command. This works because our system knows where to find these commands through the `$PATH` variable.

## Modifying $PATH.
We can manipulate the `$PATH` variable in several ways:
- Adding a directory at the end of the path
`export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`
- Adding a directory at the beginning of the path:
`export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH`
- Replacing the entire path:
`export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`

## Path Hijacking Privilege Escalation.
If we find a script owned by a more privileged user that we can execute, we can exploit path hijacking to escalate privileges. By modifying the `$PATH`, we can manipulate which commands the script uses. For example, if the script executes whoami, we can change $PATH to `export PATH=/tmp:$PATH` and create a custom whoami script in the `/tmp` directory that gives us elevated privileges `echo "/bin/bash" > whoami`. When we run the script, we will inherit the privileges of its owner.
